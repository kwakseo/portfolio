The application portal, which was revamped to meet the fall 2019 application cycle, is more streamlined and embodies the TechX brand.</p>

					<h1>motivation</h1>
						<p class="text">Techx's committees host large-scale events and competitions, such as MIT's largest hackathon, HackMIT, which attracts over a thousand college students from across the country. Thus, we put in a special effort to deliver outstanding user experience and design to the many students that we reach, leading to our reputation throughout MIT as an organization with an exceptional marketing team. 
						<br>However, our member application portal prior to the Fall 2019 cycle was not up to our standards in terms of both the user flow and appearance. Since the application is one of the first ways that potential new members interact with TechX, it is crucial for it to establish the intended impression. Therefore, as TechX's director of marketing, I led the effort to transform the application experience for our future application cycles.</p>
					<h1>the user experience</h1>
						<p class="text">According to feedback from past TechX applicants, the overarching problem with the original application portal was that the unnecessarily large amount of text on each page caused cognitive overload for potential applicants. Therefore, our team decided to eliminate all nonessential application questions, and I reorganized the page flow so that only relevant text is displayed to the applicant. 
						<br>Below, blue indicates sections that are relevant to an imaginary applicant. Before, they had to scroll past many irrelevant and distracting parts of the application in order to reach the ones that mattered. Now, only necessary sections are displayed. Moreover, the new page flow reduces the length of each page, making them more digestable.</p>

						<div class="column">
							<h2> page flow: before</h2>

						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h2>page flow: after</h2>
							<img src="../images/techx_pages2.png" class="center" style="width: 90%;">
						</div>

						<p class="text">In order to create an interface perfectly fit for the format of our application, I worked with two members of the TechX development team, Bryan Chen (MIT '21) and Kevin Fang (MIT '21), who implemented my design ideas.</p>
					
					<h1>the brand</h1>

						<p class="text">Contrary to our design standards, the UI of the original application interface &mdash; including the typography and colors &mdash; was not consistent with other TechX-branded materials. Therefore, before beginning the redesign, I established the general "look" of the portal.</p>

						<div class="row">

							<img src="../images/techx_styleguide.jpg" class="side" style="width: 550px;">

							<p class="text">The concept of my redesign is simple, clean, and modern. For typography, I looked for rounded sans-serif fonts that fit my concept and are easily readable. The colors used were taken from the standard TechX logo, and the subtle background gradient was created to add depth while retaining the visibility of the text.</p>
			
						</div>

					<h1>iteration</h1>

						<p class="text">Throughout the development process, the interface was constantly tested by TechX members who gave valuable feedback about usability that led to the final design. </p>
