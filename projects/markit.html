					<h1>field research</h1>
					<div class="row">
						<p class="text">The motivation for MarkIt came from preliminary research by visiting the Copley Square Farmers Market in Boston with several classmates. 
						<br>Throughout our visit, we took note of difficulties we experienced while browsing and shopping. I then organized our notes into three categories to address in my project.</p>

					</div>

					<h1>opportunity statement</h1>
						<p class="text">The three categories of difficulties had a common factor, which was that they stemmed from disorientation caused by unfamiliarity with the vendors, products, and layout of the market. Thus, I decided to focus my design to answer this question:</p>

						<p class="statement">How might we <strong>better inform shoppers</strong> in the farmers market 
						<br>so that they <strong>feel more directed</strong> while shopping?</p>

					<h1>storyboards & personas</h1>
						<p class="text">An important consideration in deciding what product to design was that although my target demographic was first-time shoppers, I did not want to introduce a product that disrupts the experiences of those who enjoy the market as they already know it.
						<br>Keeping this in mind, I created a storyboard visualizing a reimagined farmers market experience following two common personas for first-time shoppers.</p>

					<h1>need-finding</h1>
						<p class="text">While creating the storyboard, I found three forms of information that are currently unavailable and would improve the experience of first time shoppers:â€‹</p>

					<h1>final prototype</h1>
						<p class="text">The final prototype is a product similar to existing review apps such as Yelp. However, it has implications for <strong>marketplaces</strong>, which are not well-accounted for in such products. 
						<br>Unlike Yelp, MarkIt distinguishes reviews by specific vendors and displays the specific location of vendors' booths in the market.
						<br>Although I envisioned a physical map in my storyboard, I ultimately decided to incorporate it into a digital solution due to the adaptability of a digital map to changes in the farmers market.</p>
