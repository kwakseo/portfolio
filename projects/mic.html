					<h1>motivation</h1>

						<p class="text">MIT MIC had a major problem prior to Summer 2019, which was that they had not updated their website since 2017. Not only was their information outdated, but the original website had been put together without much attention to design. The goal of my redesign was to create a more useful, visually pleasing website that visitors would enjoy.</p>

					<h1>wireframes</h1>

						<p class="text">For the layout of the website, I focused on the needs of its visiters. The main activities that students join MIT MIC for include their weekly reading groups and workshops. Therefore, the website was redesigned so that the first thing visitors would view on the home page was information about these activities.</p>

					<h1>branding</h1>

						<div class="row">
							<img src="../images/mic_styleguide.png" class="side" style="width: 500px;">
							<p class="text">For the "look" of the website, I decided on a sleek, dark-grey background with white text and bright point colors for a tech-y feel that fits with the organization's purpose and makes MIC's iconic logo stand out. The point colors were inspired by the logo, which I revamped for a cleaner look.</p>
						</div>

					<h1>redesign</h1>

						<img src="../images/mic_animation.gif" class="center" style="width: 90%;">
						<p class="text">Because MIC's logo is very unique and is a signature of the organization, I decided to emphasize it on the home page of their website through a simple animation. This way, it has a lasting impression on visitors, who would then recognize it elsewhere. The animation also makes the website more interesting and feel less static.</p>
